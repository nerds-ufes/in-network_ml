In-Network Machine Learning
=============================
In-network machine learning experiment repository.

Description
===========
This repository contains examples of how to push Machine Learning classification models for P4 switches into the Smartnics (Netronome).


Training directory
-------------------
It contains python3 scripts responsible for transforming data from pcap files, in models suitable for deployment in the network layer.


Smartnic directory
-------------------
It contains the source codes to run the experiments into the Smartnic Netronome (https://www.netronome.com/products/agilio-cx/)


Confusion Matrixes
------------------
Next Confusion Matrix graphics are relative to classification results achieved by *MAP4* in two proposed use-cases scenarios: (a) Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and; (b) Internet of Things (IoT).
