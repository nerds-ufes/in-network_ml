In-Network Machine Learning
=============================
In-network machine learning experiment repository.

Description
===========
This repository contains examples of how to push Machine Learning classification models for P4 switches in emulators, and Smartnics (Netronome).


Training directory
-------------------
It contains python3 scripts responsible for transforming data from pcap files, in models suitable for deployment in the network layer.


<!-- Emulator directory
..-------------------
..It contains the emulation environment with Mininet running SimpleSwitch (BMv2) to run the emulated experiments.
..TODO: to describe the enviroment, packets and scripts to run P4 into Mininet.
-->

Smartnic directory
-------------------
It contains the source codes to run the experiments into the Smartnic Netronome (https://www.netronome.com/products/agilio-cx/)
